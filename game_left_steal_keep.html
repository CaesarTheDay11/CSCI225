    Finally, the game.<br>

    You keep the necklace and run away from the old man, continuing onwards down the tunnel. <br>
    You come to a split in the tunnel. One path heads right, the other left. <br>
    There is also a strange keyhole in the far wall. it oddly resembles a circle with two lines extending outwards.<br>
    It is a perfect match for the compass in your hand. You feel a faint sense of foreboding at the thought<br>
    What do you do?<br>
