    Finally, the game.<br>

    You walk to the right, continuing on for some time. Eventually you reach the exit and reunite with your family. You live a long and happy life. <br>
    You wonder what the strange keyhole was about, but you never see The Labyrinth again.<br>
    The compass is your constant companion, you are never lost, and you never take off your precious.<br>
    You live on after the deaths of your family, you live for hundreds of years. <br>
    You live until a man mugs you and steals the necklace.<br>
    All your age catches up to you at once.<br>
    You turn to ash.<br>
