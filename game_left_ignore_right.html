    <p>
      This is a quick return menu.<br>
      Here is a link to the first page:
      <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/">Visit the first GitHub page</a><br>
    And here is a link to the second page

    Finally, the game.<br>

    You walk to the right, continuing on for some time. Eventually you reach the exit and reunite with your family.<br> 
    You live a long and happy life. <br>
    You wonder what the strange keyhole was about, but you never see The Labyrinth again.<br>
