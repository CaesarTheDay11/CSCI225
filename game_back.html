    <h1>Back</h1>
    <p>
      This is a quick return menu.<br>
      Here is a link to the first page:
      <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/">Visit the first GitHub page</a><br>
    And here is a link to the second page
    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/page2.html">Visit the Second GitHub page</a><br>
    
    Finally, the game.<br>

    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/game.html">Start over?</a><br>
    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/game.html">Go Back?</a><br>
