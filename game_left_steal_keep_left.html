    Finally, the game.<br>

    You walk to the left, continuing on for some time. Eventually you arrive in a dark cave. You try to explore the cave, the compass necklace glints and guides your steps.<br>
    You walk confidently through the caves, until you arrive at an exit. <br>
    The exit is a portal, but it is the only escape from this place. <br>
    You take the portal.<br>
    You emerge in a parallel dimension to your own, identical in every way, except you, your family and your entire family for the last 5 generations never existed.<br>
    You wonder what the strange keyhole was about, but you never see The Labyrinth again.<br>
    The compass is your constant companion, you are never lost, and you never take off your precious.<br>
    Your paranoia about this world lends you caution and you buy a gun.<br>
    You live on for hundreds of years. <br>
    A man tries to mug you, you shoot him and flee. <br>
    You live forever, in safety, sequestered on a mountaintop. <br>
