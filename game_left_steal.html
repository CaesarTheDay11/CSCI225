    Finally, the game.<br>

    You run at the old man, grab the necklace and rip it off.<br>
    The necklace doesn't break, but glides smoothly into your hands like it belongs there.<br>
    The old man screams at you "Give Back my necklace! You don't understand!"<br>
    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/game_left_steal_keep.html"> Keep the compass necklace and run</a><br>
    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/game_left_ignore.html">Give the necklace back, leave the old man and keep walking</a><br>
    <a href="https://caesartheday11.github.io/CSCI225/game_back.html">Turn Back?</a><br>
