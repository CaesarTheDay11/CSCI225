    Finally, the game.<br>

    You walk to the left, continuing on for some time. Eventually you arrive in a dark cave.<br>
    You try to explore the cave, but are lost, you have no map or compass to guide you. <br>
    You wonder what the strange keyhole was about, but you never live to see it. <br>
    You die of hunger, trapped and alone in the darkness. <br>
