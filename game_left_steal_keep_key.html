    Finally, the game.<br>

    You ignore that feeling and slot the compass key into the wall, the other two doors slam shut. <br>
    A door opens in the wall, sliding the compass into the floor.<br>
    You feel a surge of sadness at the thought. <br>
    Then you look up and freeze in terror.<br>
    There is something indescribable in the chamber beyond.<br>
    It is to a crocodile as a crocodile is to a gecko, so large as to beggar belief. <br>
    It is a dragon. <br>
    You are its snack.<br>
    You die.<br>
    You watch, floating above it all as the massive dragon destroys the entire city with a blast of fire. <br>
    It continues to terrorize humanity until they are reduced to ash.<br>
    The world ends.<br>
